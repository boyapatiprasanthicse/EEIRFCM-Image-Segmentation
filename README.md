## üìú Abstract

This research presents a novel segmentation algorithm for magnetic resonance (MR) brain images ‚Äî the **Enhanced and Explored Intuitionistic Rough Based Fuzzy C-Means Approach (EEISFCMA)**.  
The method addresses challenges such as noise, partial volume effects, and intensity non-uniformity that traditional fuzzy c-means and rough set-based clustering techniques often fail to handle.  
By incorporating bias field estimation and optimized centroid initialization (using dist-max method), the approach significantly improves segmentation performance, particularly in noisy environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Contributions

- **Enhanced Segmentation Model**: Introduced EEISFCMA to improve brain MRI segmentation accuracy under noisy conditions.
- **Bias Field Correction**: Implemented bias field optimization for noise and intensity normalization.
- **Optimized Clustering**: Developed new centroid initialization using maximum distance (dist-max) evaluation to reduce iteration counts.
- **Intuitionistic Rough Sets**: Integrated rough and intuitionistic fuzzy theory for improved membership function representation.
- **Performance Improvement**: Achieved higher segmentation accuracy and Jacquard Coefficient compared to traditional methods like K-Means, FCM, GFCM, GKFCM, and SFRCM.
